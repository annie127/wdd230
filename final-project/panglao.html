                        <h3>SNORKELING IN BALICASAG ISLAND</h3>
                        <p>Balicasag island is a fish sanctuary located just 40 minutes away from Panglao island. It is
                            a great place for snorkeling because of its amazing marine life. You can even feed the
                            fishes so they will gather around you. It also has colorful coral reefs, and even huge
                            turtles. There is also jump-off not far from the snorkeling area for divers. It is a
                            favorite of divers because of the unique and diverse life you can find under.</p>

                        <h3>SUNBATHING ON VIRGIN ISLAND</h3>
                        <p>Virgin Island is a sandbar located between Alona beach and Balicasag island. There’s nothing
                            much to do here except explore the whole sandbar. You can lie on the sand and get
                            sun-tanned, or swim in the surrounding clear water. Much of the sand bar portion of Virgin
                            Island is submerged during high tide. but you can still wade in the warm clear water. Most
                            visitors just stop by here from their Balicasag tour for picture-taking since the island
                            makes a cool photo backdrop.</p>

                        <h3>EXPLORING HINAGDANAN CAVE</h3>
                        <p>If you are a fan of caves, then don’t skip Hinagdanan cave. It is not your ordinary cave
                            because
                            inside you will find a pool of clear water where you can swim. There are also a couple of
                            holes
                            that
                            let the sunlight inside, which give the cave some light.</p>

                        <h3>RELAXING AT ALONA BEACH</h3>
                        <p>Alona Beach is a famous beach on Panglao island. It is a 1.5 kilometer white sand bordered by
                            rock walls on both ends. You can walk the whole stretch of the beach in less than 20
                            minutes. On your walk, you will pass by different kinds of hotels and restaurants, where you
                            can stop and have a cool drink while sitting on the white sand enjoying the view of the
                            ocean. I recommend walking early in the morning to catch the sunrise, and later in the
                            afternoon to see the clouds turn orange when the sun sets.</p>
